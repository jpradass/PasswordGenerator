# PasswordGenerator
Tool to create secure passwords based in a wordlist by [DiceWire](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc) as it stated, long common word passwords are easy to remember and harder to crack as it takes more time to guess it by brute-force.
Bill Burr said changing password frecuently isn't secure anymore, now what matters is its length. Ilustrated in a comic by [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/936/) it's better a longer password because it has more entropy and it's harder to guess using computing calculation.
